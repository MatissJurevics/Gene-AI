# Gene: An AI assistant for Obsidian

Gene is a Free and open source AI assistant which allows you to create, modify, Translate, and overall enhance your notes.

![Demo](./Demo.gif)
## Features 

Gene uses the openai API to allow you to:
- Generate text from a prompt
- Summarise your notes
- Modify selected text in any way you want (convert to bullet points, change the tone, etc.)
- Translate your notes to any language (Including programming languages)
- Elaborate on something you dont quite understand

# How to Use
1. Go to the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/) and create an account.
2. Go to the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and create an API key.
3. Go into settings in obsidian and enable the Gene plugin.
4. Go to the Gene settings and paste your API key into the API key field.

## F.A.Q
1. **I am getting an error after inserting my API key**
    - Sometimes OpenAI requires you to verify billing details before you can use the API. Dont worry though because OpenAI provides you with **$18 of free credits for the first 3 months** and it will not cost more than $2 a month afterwards.
