# Gene: An AI assistant for Obsidian

Gene is a Free and open source GPT3.5 (ChatGPT) powered AI assistant which allows you to create, modify, Translate and enhance your notes.

![Demo](./Demo.gif)
## Features 

Gene leverages the openai API to allow you to:
- Write anything based off of a highlighted prompt.
- Elaborate on a paragraph or bullet point.
- Edit an area of highlighted text.
- Translate a selected area into whatever language you want.
- Summarise the text above.

# How to Use
1. Go to the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/) and create an account.
2. Go to the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and create an API key.
3. Go into settings in obsidian and enable the Gene plugin.
4. Go to the Gene settings and paste your API key into the API key field.

## F.A.Q
1. **I am getting an error after inserting my API key**
    - Sometimes OpenAI requires you to verify billing details before you can use the API. Dont worry though because OpenAI provides you with **$18 of free credits for the first 3 months** and it will not cost more than $2 a month afterwards.
